This is a differential equation solver which can plot the solution of almost any differential equation using

How to use
The differential equation must be writtern in the form of variables. The class variables is defined in the program

v1=variable(3,0,'x1')
v2=variable(2,0,'x2')
v3=variable(2,0,'x3')
v4=variable(3,0,'x4')

(v1+v3)*v2+v4

the above writern expression represents the differential equation (3x1+2x3)*2x2+3x4=0
x2 for example stands for 2nd derivative of x with respect to y
The program would plot the soolution of x
